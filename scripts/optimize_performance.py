print("=" * 60)
print("PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS")
print("=" * 60)

print("\n1. REDUCE DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL (k parameter)")
print("   Current: k=5 documents retrieved per query")
print("   Recommended: k=3 (40% faster retrieval)")
print("   Impact: ~1-1.5 second reduction")

print("\n2. DISABLE CLARIFICATION GENERATION (Optional)")
print("   Current: Extra LLM call for ambiguous queries")
print("   Recommended: Skip for first response, use streaming instead")
print("   Impact: ~1-2 second reduction")

print("\n3. OPTIMIZE QUERY REFORMULATION")
print("   Current: LLM call for context-aware queries")
print("   Recommended: Use simpler string concatenation")
print("   Impact: ~0.5-1 second reduction")

print("\n4. ENABLE RESPONSE STREAMING")
print("   Current: Wait for full response before sending")
print("   Recommended: Stream tokens as they're generated")
print("   Impact: Perceived latency drops to <1 second")

print("\n5. REDUCE EMBEDDING MODEL SIZE")
print("   Current: BAAI/bge-small-en (133MB)")
print("   Alternative: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (80MB, faster)")
print("   Impact: ~0.5 second reduction on cold start")

print("\n" + "=" * 60)
print("ESTIMATED TOTAL IMPROVEMENT: 3-5 seconds â†’ 1-2 seconds")
print("=" * 60)

print("\n\nWould you like to apply these optimizations? (Y/N)")
print("\nQuick fixes available:")
print("  1. Reduce k from 5 to 3 (LOW RISK)")
print("  2. Disable clarification for speed (MEDIUM RISK)")
print("  3. Simplify query reformulation (LOW RISK)")
print("  4. All of the above (RECOMMENDED)")
